# Jammming

## Overview

Jammming is a web application that allows users to search for songs, listen to previews, and create custom playlists. Users can filter their search by track, artist, album, or genre.

Once they've selected their favorite tracks, they can customize the playlist by adding a cover image, setting the name, writing a description, and choosing the privacy preference (public/private). The created playlist can then be exported directly to the user's Spotify account.

Users can log in using their Spotify credentials.

The web app is available [here](https://jammming-adrian-mosnegutu.netlify.app)

## Features

- **Search & Filter:** Find songs using filters such as track, artist, album, or genre.
- **Listen to Previews:** Listen to a short preview of the songs before adding them to your playlist. Not all songs have previews!
- **Create Custom Playlists:**
  - Choose a playlist cover.
  - Set the playlist name and description.
  - Choose privacy settings (Public/Private).
- **Spotify Integration:**
  - Log in with your Spotify account.
  - Export your custom playlist directly to Spotify.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Use the Vite development environment.
- A [Spotify account](https://www.spotify.com/signup) is required to use the app.
- Obtain a Spotify API key by registering your application on the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AdrianMosnegutu/jammming.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd jammming
   ```

3. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Create a .env file in the root directory and add your Spotify API credentials:

   ```env
   VITE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
   ```

   You only need to add the Client ID since this project uses the authorization code flow with PKCE.

5. In [constants.js](/src/utils/constants.js), modify the redirect uri to that of your application.

   ```js
   export const REDIRECT_URI = your_applicaion_redirect_uri;
   ```

### Running the app

1. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Open your browser and go to <http://localhost:5173> to use the app
